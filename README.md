# CFS-Scheduler-Simulation
This project is a simulation of the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS), a process scheduling algorithm used in the Linux kernel. The simulation demonstrates how CFS manages CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks by maintaining fairness and prioritizing tasks based on their vruntime and weight.
